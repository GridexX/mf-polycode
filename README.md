# Polycode frontend

## Naming convention

To name variables and functions, use the camelCase convention.

For react components names should capitalized CamelCase, the filename should follow the name of the react component.

## Folder architecture

Pages related to the router should be in the pages folder (path-based routing).

React components should be in the `components` folder, bse UI components should be in the `components/base` folder.

Stylesheets should be in the `styles` folder, then following the path where the style is used (try to use one stylesheet file per component/page), example : the styles for the `Home` page compenent should go in `styles/pages/Home.module.css`.

Typescript files that are not react compenents should go in the `lib` folder (for typescript files interacting with the api : `lib/api/*.ts`)

## About

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
