# Polycode frontend

## Naming convention

To name variables and functions, use the camelCase convention.

For react components names should capitalized CamelCase, the filename should follow the name of the react component.

## Folder architecture

Pages related to the router should be in the pages folder (path-based routing).

React components should be in the `components` folder, bse UI components should be in the `components/base` folder.

Stylesheets should be in the `styles` folder, then following the path where the style is used (try to use one stylesheet file per component/page), example : the styles for the `Home` page compenent should go in `styles/pages/Home.module.css`.

Typescript files that are not react components should go in the `lib` folder (for typescript files interacting with the api : `lib/api/*.ts`)

## Set backend url

To set the backen url you need to set the NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL env variable to point to the api, ex : `https://api.polycode.dopolytech.fr`.

This env variable must be set at build time.

## About

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Installing packages

- After cloning the project, you must have at least `npm >= 6` (see with `npm --version`) installed.
Then run `npm install` to install packages.

- As we are using [git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks), you must install them with
`npm run setup`. These hooks are installed using [`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
which is used in order to help you to not commit unformatted / unlinted code. Furthermore, [`commit-lint`](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) is used to ensure you respects [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). 

- Copy the file `.env.example` to `.env.local`, this new file won't be committed, it is used to define local environment
variables.

- You are now ready to code, get started with `npm run start`! ðŸš€
